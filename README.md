## Digit Classification Project
### About
This project implements a neural network in Python using the PyTorch framework to classify "handwritten" digits with $97\%$ accuracy.<br>

Accuracy of the model over 3 epochs, using batches of size $1000$

### Purpose
This project was started to learn about neural networks, as well as for furthering my familiarity with NumPy and data manipulation in Python.

## MNIST dataset

Individual images represented as $28$ x $28$ arrays filled with greyscale values $0-255$.
